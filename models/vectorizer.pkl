# FILE: vectorizer.pkl
# ================================
# PURPOSE:
# Converts cleaned text into numerical features for ML models.
#
# TASKS FOR THIS FILE:
# 1. Ensure identical feature extraction during training and prediction.
#
# EXPECTED OUTPUT:
# - Serialized vectorizer (e.g., TF-IDF)
# - Same vocabulary used in training.
#
# GENERATED BY:
# - train_emotion_model.py
# - train_intent_model.py (if shared)
#
# USED BY:
# - predict_emotion.py
# - predict_intent.py
#
# INTEGRATION NOTES:
# - Mismatch here = incorrect predictions.
# - Any preprocessing change requires retraining.
#
# OWNER:
# ML Team
#
# DO NOT:
# - Refit during prediction
# - Replace without retraining models
