FILE: response_templates.json
================================
PURPOSE:
Stores predefined chatbot responses mapped by emotion and intent.

TASKS FOR THIS FILE:
1. Define multiple responses per emotion-intent pair.
2. Ensure responses are emotionally appropriate.
3. Avoid repetitive or robotic language.

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
- Structured JSON mapping emotions + intents to responses.
- Example:
  emotion -> intent -> list of responses

CONNECTED TO:
- response_selector.py (reader)
- app.py (indirectly)

INTEGRATION NOTES:
- No code depends on HOW responses are written,
  only on the structure.
- Label names must match predict_emotion and predict_intent output.

OWNER:
Logic Team

DO NOT:
- Add logic
- Change JSON structure without coordination
