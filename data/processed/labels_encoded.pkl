# FILE: labels_encoded.pkl
# ================================
# PURPOSE:
# Stores encoded representations of emotion and/or intent labels.
#
# TASKS FOR THIS FILE:
# 1. Map string labels to numeric values.
# 2. Ensure consistent label encoding across training and inference.
#
# EXPECTED OUTPUT:
# - Serialized object (e.g., dictionary or encoder)
# - Same mapping used during prediction.
#
# GENERATED BY:
# - train_emotion_model.py
# - train_intent_model.py
#
# USED BY:
# - predict_emotion.py
# - predict_intent.py
#
# INTEGRATION NOTES:
# - Mismatched encodings will break predictions.
# - This file must align with trained models.
#
# OWNER:
# ML Team
#
# DO NOT:
# - Edit manually
# - Regenerate without retraining models
